etherlime
=========

What is etherlime?
------------------

**etherlime** is an ethereum development and deployment framework based
on [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/).

This framework provides alternative to the other web3.js based
frameworks and allows for ultimate control by the developer. It also
adds much needed verboseness in the deployment process so that you can
be aware of what is really going on (as opposed to the general shooting
in the dark technique).

This framework was born out of necessity, hardships and trouble in the
development and deployment of ethereum smart contracts. We are trying to
ease the pain of deployment, compilation and unit testing and add much
needed stability to the process. In our mind ethers is much more stable
alternative than web3.js for the moment therefore this framework is
born.

Etherlime can be used as library and/or command line tool. The command
line tools give you great boosts but you can skip them fully and use
plain old node.js including the etherlime library.
