# Deployed Contract Wrapper

## Wrappers

One of the advancements of the etherlime is the result of the deployment

* the `DeployedContractWrapper`

The `DeployedContractWrapper` is a powerful object that provides you with `ethers.Contract` amongst other functionalities. This allows you to start using your deployed contract right away as part of your deployment sequence \(f.e. you can call initialization methods\)

In addition it exposes you `verboseWaitForTransaction(transaction, transactionLabel)` function. This function can be used to wait for transaction to be mined while giving you verbose output of the state. In addition it allows you to specify a label for the transaction you are waiting for, so that you can get a better understanding of what transaction is being waited for. This comes in handy when deployment scripts start to grow.

```javascript
    const contractWrapper = await deployer.deploy(ICOTokenContract);
    const transferTransaction = await contractWrapper.transferOwnership(randomAddress);
    const result = await contractWrapper.verboseWaitForTransaction(transferTransaction,
         'Transfer Ownership');
```

If you are working with EtherlimeGanacheDeployer you will have the `from` method at your disposal. It will allow you to call certain methods from other default accounts.

```javascript
    const deployer = new etherlime.EtherlimeGanacheDeployer();
    const contractWrapper = await deployer.deploy(SomeContract);
    const tx = await contractWrapper
        .from(0 /* could be string address or ethers.Wallet instance*/).someFunction(params);
    const result = await contractWrapper.verboseWaitForTransaction(tx);
```

## Working with previously deployed contracts

Sometimes you want to work with already deployed contract. You can do this two ways:

### etherlime.ContractAt

`etherlime.ContractAt(contract, contractAddress, [signer], [providerOrPort])`

Etherlime has a convenience method allowing you to quickly wrap contracts. Passing the contract descriptor and the address it is deployed `ContractAt` will wire up an instance of the wrapper connected to etherlime ganache on the default port and default account. Optionally you can provide an account and port to connect to etherlime ganache. Alternatively if you want to connect to another provider you can pass it as last parameter, but then you must pass a signer too which is already connected to the same provider.

```javascript
    const deployedContract = etherlime.ContractAt(ContractDescriptor,
         deployedContractAddress);

    const tx = await deployedContract.someMethod(randomParam);
    const result = await deployedContract.verboseWaitForTransaction(tx);
```

### The deployer instance

The deployer object allows you to wrap such an deployed contract by it's address and continue using the power of the wrapper object. The function you can use to achieve this is `wrapDeployedContract(contract, contractAddress)`.

```javascript
    const deployedContractWrapper = deployer
        .wrapDeployedContract(SomeContractWithInitMethod, alreadyDeployedContractAddress);

    const initTransaction = await deployedContractWrapper.init(randomParam, defaultConfigs);
    const result = await deployedContractWrapper.verboseWaitForTransaction(initTransaction,
         'Init Contract');
```
