# etherlime deploy

## Syntax

```text
etherlime deploy [file] [network] [secret] [-s] [compile] [runs] [output]
```

Parameters:

* `file` - \[Optional\] By specifying `--file` you can use another

  file as long as you keep the structure of the file \(exporting an

  `async deploy` function with `network` and `secret` params\)

* `network` - \[Optional\] By specifying `--network` you can specify

  the network param to be passed to your deploy method

* `secret` - \[Optional\] By specifying `secret` you can specify the

  secret param to be passed to your deploy method. Comes in very handy

  for passing private keys.

* `-s` - \[Optional\] Silent - silences the verbose errors
* `compile` - \[Optional\] Enable compilation of the smart contracts

  before their deployment. By default the deployment is done with a

  compilation

* `runs` - \[Optional\] Enables the optimizer and runs it the

  specified number of times

* `output` - \[Optional\] Defines the way that the logs are shown.

  Choices: `none` - silences the output of logs, `normal` - see

  verbose logs in the console and `structured` - structured output in

  a file meant for inter program communication.

Running this command will deploy the file specified \(defaults to `./deployment/deploy.js`\) The deployment process is verbose and gives you real-time info about the performed actions. In addition there is a report of the actions when the deployment finishes \(as not all of us monitor the deployment process constantly\):
