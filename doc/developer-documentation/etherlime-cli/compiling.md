# etherlime compile

Running this command will compile all smart contracts along with imported sources. The command comes with integrated solidity and vyper compiler and would automatically fetch all files with '.sol' and '.vy' extensions and would record the compiled json object in './build' folder. Note! To enable the vyper compiler you need to have running docker.

## Syntax

```text
etherlime compile [dir] [runs] [solcVersion] [docker] [list] [all]
[quiet] [output] [buildDirectory] [workingDirectory] [deleteCompiledFiles]
```

Parameters:

* `dir` - \[Optional\] By specifying `dir` you can set the root

  directory where to read the contracts and place the build folder. By

  default `dir` is set to the current working directory `./`

* `runs` - \[Optional\] By specifying `runs` between 1 and 999 you

  enabled the optimizer and set how many times the optimizer will be

  run. By default the optimizer is not enabled.

* `solcVersion` - \[Optional\] By specifying `solcVersion` you can set

  the version of the solc which will be used for compiling the smart

  contracts. By default it use the solc version from the node\_modules

  folder.

* `docker` - \[Optional\] When you want to use a docker image for your

  solc you should set `docker=true` in order `solcVersion` to accept

  the passed image.

* `list` - \[Optional\] By specifying `list` you can list the

  available solc versions. The following values can be used: `docker`,

  `releases`, `prereleases` and `latestRelease`. By default only 10

  version are listed

* `all` - \[Optional\] By specifying `all` together with `list` you

  will be able to list all available solc versions.

* `quiet` - \[Optional\] Disable verboseness during compilation. By

  the default `quiet` is set to false.

* `output` - \[Optional\] Defines the way that the logs are shown.

  Choices: `none` - silences the output of logs, `normal` - see

  verbose logs in the console and `structured` - structured output in

  a file meant for inter program communication.

* `buildDirectory` - \[Optional\] Defines the directory for placing

  builded contracts.

* `workingDirectory` - \[Optional\] Defines the folder to use for

  reading contracts from, instead of the default one: `./contracts`.

  Here can be specified also a single solidity file for compiling e.g:

  `/contracts/LimeFactory.sol`.

* `deleteCompiledFiles` - \[Optional\] Delete the files in the

  compilation contract directory before compiling. By the default

  `deleteCompiledFiles` is set to false.

The `solcVersion` can accept the following values:

* \ - passing undefined or simply don't using the

  solcVersion argument will use the solc version from the local

  node\_modules

* \ - you can pass directly the version of the solc.

  Example: `--solcVersion=0.4.24`

* \ - the image which will be used to load the solc into the

  docker. Example:

  `nightly-0.4.25-a2c754b3fed422b3d8027a5298624bcfed3744a5`

* \ - you can pass the absolute path to a local solc
* \ - when you set the solc version argument to `native` the

  compiler is using the solc globally installed on your machine
