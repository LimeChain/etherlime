### Workflow of etherlime coverage

* The `coverage` command copy all test files from test directory to `.coverage_tests` temporary directory
* The `coverage` command copy all contract files from contract directory to `.coverage_contracts` temporary directory
* All contract files are builded **without optimization** from temporary directory and saved to `.coverage_artifacts` directory
* All test files are run, `coverage` folder is created with the result and all temporary directories are deleted.

Parameters:

* `path` - \[Optional\] By specifying `path` you can set a path to a

  milliseconds. Defaults to 2000 ms.

  choose a specific solc version to be used for compilation and

  coverage reports.

* `workingDirectory` - \[Optional\] Defines the folder to use for

    reading contracts from, instead of the default one: ./contracts

* `html` - \[Optional\] By specifying `html` you can choose either to
