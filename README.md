# etherlime

**etherlime** is an ethereum development and deployment framework based on [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/).

This framework provides alternative to the other web3.js based frameworks and allows for ultimate control by the developer. It also adds much needed verboseness in the deployment process so that you can be aware of what is really going on (as opposed to the general shooting in the dark technique).

This framework was born out of necessity, hardships and trouble in the development and deployment of ethereum smart contract. We are trying to ease the pain of deployment, compilation and unit testing and add much needed stability to the process. In our mind ethers is much more stable alternative than web3.js for the moment therefore this framework is born.

**Milestones:**
1. Being able to deploy compiled contracts (compiled in the truffle format) on local and infura nodes <---- We are here
2. [Not Ready]Being able to compile contracts to the desired formats for deployment
3. [Not Ready]Being able to run unit tests on the compiled contracts

## Installing

```
npm install etherlime
```

## Running embedded ganache-cli

For easier integration and usage of the upcoming EtherlimeGanacheDeployer and running local deployments you can use the embedded ganache-cli. It comes with fixed 10 accounts and a lot of eth (191408831393027885698 to be precise)

```
etherlime ganache
```

## Deploying

**etherlime** exposes the following deployers:
- `InfuraPrivateKeyDeployer(privateKey, network, apiKey, defaultOverrides)` - given private key to the deployment wallet, the network (as found in `ethers.providers.networks`), your infura API key and default deployment settings for `gasPrice` and `gasLimit` it exposes you a deployer object.

- `JSONRPCDeployer(privateKey, nodeUrl, defaultOverrides)` - given private key to the deployment wallet, the url to the node you are trying to connect (local or remote) and default deployment settings for `gasPrice` and `gasLimit` it exposes you a deployer object.

- `EtherlimeGanacheDeployer(privateKey, nodeUrl, defaultOverrides)` - given private key to the deployment wallet, the url to the node you are trying to connect (local or remote) and default deployment settings for `gasPrice` and `gasLimit` it exposes you a deployer object.


All deployers share the same base functionality:

### Deployer functionality

The main functionality the deployer exposes is (obviously) the ability to deploy compiled contract.

This is achieved through the `deploy(contract)` function. As mentioned before, the contract is descriptor object that needs to have atleast the following three fields:
- `contractName` - the name of the contract
- `abi` - the abi interface of the contract
- `bytecode` - the compiled bytecode

 *All of these you can get by compiling with Truffle. We will soon expose you a way to do this through etherlime.*

 **Example**

```
const etherlime = require('etherlime');

const TestContract = require('./TestContract.json');

const defaultConfigs = {
	gasPrice: 20000000000,
	gasLimit: 4700000
}

const deployer = new etherlime.InfuraPrivateKeyDeployer('Your Private Key Goes Here', 'ropsten', 'Your Infura API Key', defaultConfigs);

const runDeployment = async () => {
	
	const result = await deployer.deploy(TestContract, '0xda8a06f1c910cab18ad187be1faa2b8606c2ec86', 1539426974);
}

runDeployment();
```

### Deployed Contract Wrapper
One of the advancements of the etherlime is the result of the deployment - the `DeployedContractWrapper`

The `DeployedContractWrapper` is a powerful object that provides you with `ethers.Contract` amongst other functionalities. This allows you to start using your deployed contract right away as part of your deployment sequence (f.e. you can call initialization methods)

In addition it exposes you `verboseWaitForTransaction(transactionHash, transactionLabel)` function. This function can be used to wait for transaction to be mined while giving you verbose output of the state. In addition it allows you to specify a label for the transaction you are waiting for, so that you can get a better understanding of what transaction is being waited for. This comes in handy when deployment scripts start to grow.


**Example**
```
const contractWrapper = await deployer.deploy(ICOTokenContract);
const transferTransaction = await contractWrapper.contract.transferOwnership(randomAddress);
const result = await contractWrapper.verboseWaitForTransaction(transferTransaction.hash, 'Transfer Ownership');
```

### Working with previously deployed contracts

Sometimes you want to work with already deployed contract. The deployer object allows you to wrap such an deployed contract by it's address and continue using the power of the wrapper object. The function you can use to achieve this is `wrapDeployedContract(contract, contractAddress)`.

**Example**
```
const deployedContractWrapper = deployer.wrapDeployedContract(SomeContractWithInitMethod, alreadyDeployedContractAddress);

const initTransaction = await deployedContractWrapper.contract.init(randomParam, defaultConfigs);
const result = await deployedContractWrapper.verboseWaitForTransaction(initTransaction.hash, 'Init Contract');
```
